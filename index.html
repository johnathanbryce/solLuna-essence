                Tarot and Oracle cards have long provided
                spiritual guidance—Tarot since the 15th
                century with its symbolic cards, and Oracle as

                an intuitive,

                channeled tool. Before your reading, you can
                ask specific questions or opt for a general life
                reading. Each session explores your past,
                present, and future, offering insights from
                Spirit and guidance for your journey ahead.

                This modality is gentle yet powerful, using
                specific techniques to clear blockages in the
                body. Blockages occur when emotions
                (energy) aren’t fully processed. Unresolved
                emotions like trauma, guilt, and anger can
                become stored energy, sometimes lasting for
                years, and may eventually manifest as dis-ease.
                Through these gentle techniques, I help
                restore the body’s natural energy flow,
                promoting healing and recovery.

                Kundalini energy resides at the base of the spine.
                When activated through meditation—
                incorporating prana (breath), mantra (sound),
                and mudra (movement)—the energy rises up the
                spine to the crown of the head and beyond. This
                process refreshes all 10 of our energy bodies.
                Kundalini Meditation is highly beneficial for
                various conditions, particularly for mental health,
                feeling "stuck," or breaking old patterns. It’s an
                excellent practice for healing the nervous system,
                releasing blocks, and boosting vitality.

              Hi, I'm Syd.
              I’m a certified Bio-Energy Healing Practitioner, Yoga instructor, and
              Intuitive reader based in Vancouver, BC. My mission is to help my clients
              reconnect to the wonders that surrounds them—and, more importantly,
              the power within. As Roald Dahl said, “Those who do not believe in magic
              will never find it.” Healing is a journey, and I’m here to meet you
              wherever you're at, offering a safe space to nurture your mind, body, and
              spirit back to your light.

            </p>
           <br />
            <p class="bio__article__description">
              Where it all began:
              <br />
              <br />

            I’ve always been a healer. There wasn’t a single moment that led me here—
            this has always been my path. From a young age, I was drawn to healing
            and a deeper way of being. I craved something different, though I didn’t
            fully understand it until I discovered my connection to what I call ‘the
            magic.’ For me, ‘the magic’ is the deep connection between mind, body,
            and spirit—a sacred space unique to each individual. Exploring these
            practices during my own healing journey made me feel more seen and less
            alone, which is why I am so honored to share them with you.
            <br />
            <br />
            Healing is rarely done alone.

              I received a reading from Sydney and it was truly so beautiful.
              The way she was able to very clearly tap in and navigate the
              energies that are active in my life while merging it with
              wonderful advice, insight and clairvoyant and channelled messaging
              was so incredible. The way she connects to the messages is unique
              and powerful yet clear and easy to understand. I highly recommend
              working with and receiving the magic that Sydney has to offer.

              My first ever bio-energy healing session was peaceful and

              my personal goals. An emotional and physical experience despite no

              My experiences with Syd for bio-energy healing and elevations are
              always my most honoured and gifted time of self-care. Syd enables
              an energy outward so that I am able to fully be at ease in my own
              skin. I felt that I was held safely and respectfully while
              expunging stress and encumbrances that do not serve my energetic
              body. If you have the Grace to be gifted in resonance with this
              Divine Healer, I wholeheartedly recommend her acumen, and the
              woman she has cultivated herself to be. She holds you well and
              revives your essence. Deep gratitude to this light. Thanks, Sydney

              I have had 3 Tarot readings with Sydney about 6 months apart and
              found them to be amazing. Sydney's ability to read the past,
              present, and speak to the future with such accuracy is remarkable.
              In each reading, she spoke of things before they happened and I
              was then able to watch them unfold. I also enjoyed the delivery of
              the readings in short video snippets. The enthusiasm Sydney is
              able to convey is contagious, and I would highly recommend a tarot
              reading with Sydney.

             My tarot card reading with Sydney was incredible. I was in a transition in my life when I received the reading and it helped me so much to be confident in the decisions at the time. This card reading was the most inspiring reading I have ever had. Everything that was shared in the reading has come true. The reading gave me so much confidence in my life path. I am so grateful to Sydney for her super tapped-in intuition.
