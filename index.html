                Tarot and Oracle have been around as reliable spiritual guidance for centuries. Tarot especially has been around since the 15th century and comes with its own history and meaning behind each card while Oracle is completely intuitive and channeled. Before the reading,there is an opportunity to ask specific questions about a certain area of your life that you may want clarity on, or you can choose a general life reading. Each reading follows the same structure; past, present and future. I will dive into each section providing you messages from spirit and guidance moving forward.

                This holistic modality is a soft yet extremely powerful healing
                practice. With its non-invasive approach, I am able to use
                specific techniques to remove and clear blockages within the
                body. What are 'blockages'? From a basic science standpoint, we
                know that everything is made from atoms, and atoms are made from
                energy. Therefore emotions are energy. Blockages occur when we
                don't fully process and release emotions, this can happen when
                we experience PTSD, trauma, pain, guilt, anger, shame, etc. We
                can store this unwanted energy for an extremely long period of
                time. Most of us are still carrying stored energy from
                childhood. In heightened cases, this energy can start showing up
                as a disease and chronic conditioning. But with specific gentle
                techniques, I am able to clear and allow the energy to return to
                its natural flow state ultimately restoring and recovering the
                body.

                Kundalini energy is located at the base of the spine within us all. When activated by meditation, which in this case includes; prana (breath), mantra (sound), and mudra (movement). The goal here is to guide the kundalini energy up the spine reaching to the top of our head and beyond. This affects all of our 10 energy bodies, almost like pressing the 'refresh button'. Kundalini Meditation has been known to be extremely helpful for a variety of conditions, but I would highly recommend this practice if you're battling with mental health, feeling 'stuck', or having difficulty breaking old patterning. This is a great way to recover the nervous system, get out of your own way and create more vitality.

              Hello, I'm Syd. I am a certified Bio-Energy Healing Practitioner, Yoga instructor, and Intuitive reader based in Vancouver, BC. I'm here to reconnect my clients back to the magic all around and more importantly within. As Roald Dahl says, "those who do not believe in magic will never find it." Healing comes in phases and I am here to honor you wherever you're at in your journey, offering space to nurture that mind, body, and spirit of yours back to your light.

            <p class="bio__article__description">Where it all began...
              Where it all began:
              <br />

              I was born a healer. There was never a pivotal moment in my life that made me change my path into this world, this was always my world. Since I was little I have always been drawn to energy, healing, the moon, and another way of being. I craved something different, but I never really knew what that difference was until I discovered my connection to the 'magic'. What's the 'magic'? For me, it's the connection between my mind, body, and spirit all culminating as one and expanding beyond my physical self. I found this to be a deeply sacred space that allowed me to heal from my own trauma and battles. This space gave me my spark back, time and time again. So that's why I'm here, so excited and honored to be sharing these offerings with you. </p>

              I received a reading from Sydney and it was truly so beautiful.
              The way she was able to very clearly tap in and navigate the
              energies that are active in my life while merging it with
              wonderful advice, insight and clairvoyant and channelled messaging
              was so incredible. The way she connects to the messages is unique
              and powerful yet clear and easy to understand. I highly recommend
              working with and receiving the magic that Sydney has to offer.

              My experiences with Syd for bio-energy healing and elevations are
              always my most honoured and gifted time of self-care. Syd enables
              an energy outward so that I am able to fully be at ease in my own
              skin. I felt that I was held safely and respectfully while
              expunging stress and encumbrances that do not serve my energetic
              body. If you have the Grace to be gifted in resonance with this
              Divine Healer, I wholeheartedly recommend her acumen, and the
              woman she has cultivated herself to be. She holds you well and
              revives your essence. Deep gratitude to this light. Thanks, Sydney

              I have had 3 Tarot readings with Sydney about 6 months apart and
              found them to be amazing. Sydney's ability to read the past,
              present, and speak to the future with such accuracy is remarkable.
              In each reading, she spoke of things before they happened and I
              was then able to watch them unfold. I also enjoyed the delivery of
              the readings in short video snippets. The enthusiasm Sydney is
              able to convey is contagious, and I would highly recommend a tarot
              reading with Sydney.

             My tarot card reading with Sydney was incredible. I was in a transition in my life when I received the reading and it helped me so much to be confident in the decisions at the time. This card reading was the most inspiring reading I have ever had. Everything that was shared in the reading has come true. The reading gave me so much confidence in my life path. I am so grateful to Sydney for her super tapped-in intuition.
